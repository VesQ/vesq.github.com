    <p class="ingress">A not-so-finished game made with canvas+JavaScript</p>

      <!-- create canvas here with javascript -->
    </div> <!-- #canvascontainer -->

    <p>Your goal is to collect all the coins (the spinning grey ones) and then come back to the start. The red thing that is supposed to represent a door will have turned green. Touch it and see something <span class="ironic"><small>un</small>cool</span> happen!</p>
    <p>You can move around with <mark>arrow keys</mark> and jump with <mark>Z</mark>.</p>
    <p><mark>Pause</mark>-button works as an emergency stop. You will have to refresh the page to play again.</p>
    <p>Oh, and do try the <mark>F11</mark>, it will bring the game to fullscreen! Although it will most likely lag and get you stuck at the walls, but it's anyways a nice functionality :)</p>
